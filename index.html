  ## First things first
]

Requirements for this workshop:

- an Azure Subscription

tools: 

- `git`, 
- an editor (vs `code`, `vi`, `emacs`, `nano`), 
- `az` - azure cli.
- `ssh`
 
or the cloud shell at [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com)

Before we proceed, please do this now:

1. Clone this repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dcasati/terraform-bootcamp.git
  ```
2. If you are using VS Code, install the Terraform extension:

Infrastructure as Code: 

- **SPEEDS** up the deployment of new infrastructure

- **ALLOWS** you to version control your infrastructure, making it easy to perform roll-backs

- **ENABLES** a repeatable model for deploying your infrastructure, reducing the "fat-finger-effect"

  ## What is it?

.right-column[
Using Infrastructure as Code brings some important considerations: 

- How to provide file isolation, file locking and safeguard the state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform? 

- Declarative vs Imperative.

The good: 

  - Its clear, concise, reproducible method are a plus. 
  
The bad: 

  - The drawback to have in mind is this: when not careful, a commit can break your entire infrastructure. 
  
The ugly: 

  - This could be your production.red[*] and staging environment.

  .footnote[.red[*] Version control and file isolation can mitigate most of these issues.]

## Terraform

.left-column[
  ## What is Terraform ?
]
.right-column[
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular 
service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter. 
Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the 
described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution 
plans which can be applied.

The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well 
as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.


More on the [Terraform website](http://www.terraform.io).

  ## What is Terraform ?
  ### - Installing Terraform
]
.right-column[
Terraform is distributed as a binary package for various OSes, including: Linux, MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows and Solaris.

download the binary at: [https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

Another option is to use the Cloud Shell on Azure at [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com)
]

.left-column[
  ## What is Terraform ?
  ### - Installing Terraform
  ### - Verifying the Installation
]
.right-column[

Run the following command on a terminal: `terraform`. You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
$ terraform
Usage: terraform [--version] [--help] <command> [args]

The available commands for execution are listed below.
The most common, useful commands are shown first, followed by
less common or more advanced commands. If you're just getting
started with Terraform, stick with the common commands. For the
other commands, please read the help and docs before usage.

Common commands:
    apply              Builds or changes infrastructure
    console            Interactive console for Terraform interpolations
    destroy            Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure
    env                Workspace management
    fmt                Rewrites config files to canonical format
    get                Download and install modules for the configuration
    graph              Create a visual graph of Terraform resources
    import             Import existing infrastructure into Terraform
    init               Initialize a Terraform working directory
    output             Read an output from a state file
    plan               Generate and show an execution plan
    providers          Prints a tree of the providers used in the configuration
    push               Upload this Terraform module to Atlas to run
    refresh            Update local state file against real resources
    show               Inspect Terraform state or plan
```

Terraform uses an Azure AD service principal to provision resources on Azure. Here we have two options:

1. Manually setup the service principal as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-install-configure#set-up-terraform-access-to-azure)
1. Use the [setup_terraform.sh](https://github.com/dcasati/terraform-bootcamp/blob/master/tools/setup_terraform.sh) found under the `tools/` directory.

1. If not done already, log into Azure
   ```bash
   $ az login
   ```
1. Next, select a SUBSCRIPTION
   ```bash
   $ az account list -o table
   ```
1. The output should look similar to this

<pre><code>

1. Create a test file with the following information.red[*]:

  provider "azurerm" {
  }
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
          name = "testResourceGroup"
          location = "westus"
  }
  ```
  
1. then run `terraform init` to bootstrap Terraform.

1. verify what will be created with `terraform plan`

1. create the infrastructure with `terraform apply`

1. clean up with `terraform destroy`

  ## Running a sample script
  ### - init
]
.right-column[
  
Run `terraform init` to bootstrap Terraform.

  ```bash
  $ terraform init

  Initializing provider plugins...
  - Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
  - Downloading plugin for provider "azurerm" (1.3.2)...

  The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
  so the latest version was installed.

  To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
  changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
  corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
  suggested below.

  * provider.azurerm: version = "~> 1.3"

  Terraform has been successfully initialized!

  You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
  any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
  should now work.

  If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
  rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
  commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
  ```

  ## Running a sample script

Verify what will be created with `terraform plan`

<pre><code>
  $ terraform plan

  The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
  persisted to local or remote state storage.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:

  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
  can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
  "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
